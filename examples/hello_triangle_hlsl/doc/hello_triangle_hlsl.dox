    @page hello_triangle_hlsl Hello Triangle HLSL
    @ingroup kdgpu-examples

    @brief This example shows how to use HLSL shader that will be compiled with DXC.

    This example showcases the minimal changes needed to use HLSL shaders instead of the usual GLSL. Read the [Hello Triangle](#hello_triangle) example to see the differences.

    The main difference is to set the path in the hello_triangle_hlsl.cpp to the proper shader.

       @snippet hello_triangle_hlsl/hello_triangle_hlsl.cpp 8

    To compile the shaders, the shaders need to be added to the assets directory where, within the CMakeLists.txt file the shaders will automatically be compiled into Spir-V with the use of DXC when the code is compiled.
